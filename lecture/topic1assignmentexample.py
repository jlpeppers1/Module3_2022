"""
In the shell or in a text editor, write a program that asks for the user to sign up for Programmer's Toolkit Monthly Subscription Box. They must select level of membership they want. Each month is something different, t-shirts, stickers, figurines, even programming books!
The levels are the following:
    Platinum
    Gold
    Silver
    Bronze
    Free Trial
Write an if statement that prints the cost for each of the level. Platinum is $60, each level below is 10 dollars cheaper, and the free trial is free.
Submit your .py file.
