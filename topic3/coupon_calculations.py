You are online shopping at SuperAwesomeCouponDealsAndStuff.com. They offer two types of discounts, cash-off coupons and percent discount coupons. You must add tax after applying coupons. If you have cash-off coupons, those must be applied first, then apply the percent discount coupons on the pre-tax amount.
The following is the order of calculations:
The first is cash-off coupons, that you earn by shoppings. You may apply one $5 or $10 cash off per order.
The second is percent discount coupons for 10%, 15%, or 20% off.
The third is tax
The fourth is shipping according to the the following guidelines:
    up to $10 dollars, shipping is $5.95
    $10 and up to $30 dollars, shipping is $7.95
    $30 and up to $50 dollars, shipping is $11.95
    Shipping is free for $50 and over
In this program, prompt the user for the the amount of the purchase, the cash coupon, the percent coupon. Then calculate and return the total order item.

For instance, you have $5 off and 30% coupons and your item is $15.99, you will first take
    $15.99 - $5.00 = $10.99.
    30% off $10.99 to get $7.69
    Add tax at 6% to get $8.15
    Add shipping cost before tax $5.95 to get $14.10
Do not forget to use variables and constants where appropriate. Using varialabes, the first line might look like the following:
    cash_off_subtotal = price - cash_off

#hardcode a price or get from user input; set to a variable
#part or step 1
    #if cash_coupon then
        #do calculation
    #set a post cash coupon total variable (price after coupon)
    #add a print statement here while you are working on it or debugging
#part or step 2
    #if percent_coupon then
        #do calculation
    #set a post percent coupon total variable (Discount % amt)
#Third step is to do tax; you can pick a tax rate
    #set to a subtotal
#Fourth is shipping (nested if statements)
    #if the subtotal is less than 10, charge X amount for shipping
    #etc...
#print out the total in a 'pretty' format
